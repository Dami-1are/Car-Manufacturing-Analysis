### Descriptive Data Analysis
This focuses on summarizing historical data to understand what happened in the past.
-  What is the Total Sales by Brand?
-  What is the Total Revenue by Location?
-  The Average Price by Mileage Category?
-  What is the Yearly Sales Trend?
-  What is the Brand Performance Comparison?



### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarised as follows:
1. Total Sales by Brand: Toyota and Hyundai have the highest total sales, indicating strong market performance. Chevrolet, Ford, and Honda also show competitive sales volumes, but slightly behind the leaders.
2. Total Revenue by Location: The revenue distribution reveals that certain locations contribute significantly more to total revenue. This suggests that these areas could be key markets for car sales, warranting focused marketing or sales strategies.
3. Average Price by Mileage Category: Cars with lower mileage are sold at higher average prices (around $23K), while those with medium and high mileage have similar, lower average prices (around $19K). This confirms the general trend that lower mileage vehicles retain higher value.
4. Yearly Sales Trend: There is a relatively consistent trend in sales from 2015 to 2020, with minor fluctuations. The data suggests stability in sales performance over the years, which might indicate a mature market or steady consumer demand.
5. Brand Performance Comparison: A closer look reveals Toyota not only leads in sales volume but also generates the highest revenue, underscoring its dual strength in market penetration and value generation.


### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
-  Focus marketing and sales efforts in the regions identified as high-revenue areas.
-  For brands with lower sales or revenue, investigate potential reasons such as pricing, product features, or customer preferences.
-  Since lower mileage vehicles command higher prices, highlight this aspect in sales and marketing campaigns.
-  Identify underperforming regions and explore potential opportunities to expand.
-  For brands with steady but not leading sales, consider introducing new models or offering incentives.
-  Use the stable yearly sales trend to plan inventory management.
